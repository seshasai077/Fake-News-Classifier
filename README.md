ðŸ§  Fake News Classifier
A full-stack machine learning web application designed to detect misinformation in news articles using natural language processing and logistic regression.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap (responsive UI with real-time feedback)

Backend: Flask (Python), RESTful routing

Modeling: Scikit-learn (TF-IDF vectorization + Logistic Regression)

Deployment: Render (cloud-hosted with dynamic port binding)

Version Control: GitHub

ðŸ“Š Key Features
Trained on the WELFake dataset, with preprocessing and label balancing to improve classification accuracy.

Uses TF-IDF vectorizer to extract meaningful features from text and a Logistic Regression model with class_weight='balanced' to counter dataset bias.

Predicts whether a news headline or article is real or fake, with emoji-coded feedback for user clarity.

Fully deployed on Render with public access, allowing users to test headlines via a clean web interface.

Includes modular code structure (app.py, train_model.py, requirements.txt, templates/index.html) for maintainability and scalability.

ðŸš€ Impact
Demonstrates end-to-end ML deployment skillsâ€”from data ingestion and model training to cloud hosting and UI integration.

Serves as a portfolio-ready project showcasing AI-ML proficiency, backend engineering, and user-centric design.
